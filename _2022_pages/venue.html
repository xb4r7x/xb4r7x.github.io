      <p><b>Info</b><br><small> Formerly Emerald Dunes A & B, the two villas have been combined to make one large vacation home.  You'll be just steps from the surf and sand as you enjoy your stay in this popular dream home. The deluxe oceanfront ten bedroom house is a hot selection so be sure to reserve your vacation week early. Enjoy ten full baths, plus two half-baths, and a ground-level game room with a kitchenette, air hockey, and a card/game table... just right for hours of family fun. Please note, game room has an outside entry and there is not interior access between the 2 sides of the home.</small></p>

      <p><b>Address</b><br><small>907 Ocean Blvd, North Myrtle Beach, SC</small></p>
